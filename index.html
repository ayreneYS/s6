        <h2>Who is Apo Whang Od</h2>
        <p class="content">
          Maria Whang Od Oggay, popularly known as Apo Whang Od is a living
          testimony showcasing the art of tattooing. She is the oldest tattoo
          artist from the Northern Mountain in the Philippines, Kalinga, in a
          small village called Buscalan. Apo Whang Od is not only the oldest
          tattoo artist in the world. She was also the first woman to become a
          tattoo artist in her tribe known as But-but Tribe. She is 103 years
          old now, still leaving an ink legacy in the skin of many locals and
          tourists. She started tattooing when she was 15 years old. During that
          time, tattoos were given to men in the village for good luck in their
          battles and marriage and for fertility for the women. But as time went
          by, some trekkers would come across Buscalan village and saw the
          tattoos of the villagers. Tourists started coming in 2009 after a
          documentary about Apo Whang Od, “Tattoo Hunter” by an American
          anthropologist, Lars Krutak, was filmed. She appears to change the
          future of this small village in Kalinga from then on.Apo Whang Od has
          her unique way of marking tattoos. She doesn’t let you use your own
          design. She has 20 designs tourists can choose from. Each design has a
          meaning… for protection, for direction and for long life. She doesn’t
          use a tattoo machine. She makes her own ink from charcoal and water.
          Her needles are made from dried thorns from the trees, fastened to a
          bamboo stick. Her own way of drawing on skin is by tapping the needle
          in a fast proper way, putting right pressure so blood will not burst.
          At 103, her hands are still very firm, steady and strong and she can
          tap 100 taps in one minute. As it sounds, perhaps a test of your pain
          tolerance.
